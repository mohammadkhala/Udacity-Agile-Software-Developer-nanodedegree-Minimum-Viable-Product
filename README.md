Project Scenario & Templates
How to Use the Templates
Introduction
As you learned throughout this course, the Product Owner is largely responsible for determining ‘what’ the development team works on and the priority of that work while the development team determines ‘how’ the work should be completed. It is very important that all members of an Agile team understand and are able to create a good product vision, product roadmap, and user stories. In this project you are going to practice creating a product vision, product roadmap, release plan, user stories with acceptance criteria, and ultimately a MVP plan for a software product.

Scenario
You work at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on the infectious disease tracking & prevention team and there is currently a world wide virus outbreak that is at pandemic levels. The top public health official at the CDC has asked you to work with the software development team to develop a product that tracks the spread of the virus in an effort to help stop and prevent the virus from spreading further. There is currently no vaccine or cure for the virus and the CDC wants to know where to apply funding, where to send test kits, and eventually be able to track the status of vaccine and cure creation.

Here are a few clear and critical outcomes for the first release of the product to be successful:

It is critical that anyone in the U.S. is able to report that they have contracted the virus
It is critical to show heat maps of the outbreak
It is critical to be able to track and compare the
# of virus test kits that health care companies have created.
# of virus test kits administered by the test centers
It is critical that medical examiners are able to report the number of deaths caused by the virus
Some less important and unclear outcomes for the product are: State and Local Government Officials want to push out updates to the public through the product Local Doctors need to be able to report successful remedies and cures for patients that have contracted the virus. Having the ability to track the # of virus test kits that have been delivered to test centers

The Agile development team you are a member of is using the Scrum framework. The team is working in 2-week sprints and has an established velocity of 8 story points/sprint. The following table shows which features have more or less dependencies and you can use this information to help you prioritize features on the Product Roadmap.
